# Open Source Graphic Editor

To use, download the full files here: https://github.com/monetizedesign/graphic-editor/archive/master.zip

Open the `index.html` file inside your web browser. Add text, shapes, upload images and have access to basic graphic editing.

### Goal

This is being released in hopes that someone will be able to improve the editor and add it to their own project. 

If you are not a developer to use the code you can find a JavaScript developer who can easily apply your own custom features.

### Dependencies

To make this all work there is a variety of other open source code used:

- FabricJS - http://fabricjs.com/
- Select2 - https://select2.org/
- Spectrum (color picker) - https://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/
- Gradient Picker - https://github.com/artf/grapick
